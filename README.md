# White-Stork-Project Code

This is the readme.md file for the White Stork Project code (written by Lizzie Jones). Code is stored in privately in github and pushed daily, then reviewed before merging with the master. rMarkdown files are created periodically as word doucments and added to the main 'results' GoogleDoc.
